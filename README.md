# Styled Markup Language (SML)
A new way to style websites. Use XML to specify your styles.


## How it works

Using a regular HTML file you can define your content as usual. Then, using a JS file, you can define your styles in a XML format similar to HTML (currenlty it uses the built in DOM parser but that will change to a custom XML schema).

##### example.html
```html
<body root="userCard">
  <div>
    <div>
      <img src="profile_pic.PNG" alt="User Profile Picture">
      <h2>Seespler</h2>
      <p>Combat level: 94</p>
      <p>Cash Stack Color: 
        <span>Green</span>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script src="./example.js"></script>
</body>
```
##### example.js
```js
const cardStyles = `
  <body>
    m-0 flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-[#c8b68e]
    <div>
      text-center 
      <div>
        w-[300px] p-[20px] rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-[#473f35] text-white
        <img>
          w-[150px] h-[150px] rounded-full object-cover mb-4 mx-auto
        </img>
        <h2>
          mb-2 text-xl
        </h2>
        <p>
          mb-2 text-lg
        </p>
        <p>
          <span> text-[#00ff80] </span>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
`;
```

The entry point of the styles is defined in the HTML file, with the "root" attribute, seen in the HTML code in the body tag. Then the styles are applied via the implementStyles function:

```js
  implementStyles(cardStyles, "userCard");
```

Then the results can be seen by opening the HTML file in the browser:

## Further Development

### Selectors
A list of selectors could be defined to be used in the same way that css selectors are used. For example, `sibling`, `any`, and `next`, could be used to select the sibling elemnts, all elements, and the next element, respecitively.

Something like: 

```
<div.any> 
  <!-- add styles here --> 
</div.any>
```

or 

```
<div any> 
  <!-- add styles here --> 
</div>
``` 
could be a way to use these selectors in the style markup folder. Though selects wouldn't be entirely necessary as one could very explicity specify which element they are targetting with just the markup.


## Notes
- This is currently just something I thought would be interesting, not meant to be a production level idea at this point.
- I understand that it would probably be a pain to copy and paste your HTML code into your CSS file so that you could style it, and this would create code duplication technically. 
- Some sort of tooling could be used to quickly select only the element tages in the HTMl to make copying over to CSS file easier.
- I used the Tailwind CSS CDN to quickly hack together a proof of conecpt for this idea.
